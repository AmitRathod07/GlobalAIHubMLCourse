1) How would you define Machine Learning?    
 Answer:
     -Machine Learning is an Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) it gives devices the ability to 
     learn from their experiences and improve their self without doing any coding. For Example, 
     when you shop from any website itâ€™s shows related search like:- People who bought also saw this.

       -Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is 
     the study of making machines more human-like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to 
     learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, 

      i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on 
     the experiences of the machines throughout the process. Good quality data is fed to the machines, 
     and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. 
     The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand, 
     and the type of activity that needs to be automated.

2) What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning? Specify example 3 algorithms for each of these.
 Answer:
 
 Supervised learning
     1] Supervised learning as the name indicates the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. 
     Basically supervised learning is a learning in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled that means some data is already tagged with 
     the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that supervised learning algorithm analyses 
     the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data. 
1) How would you define Machine Learning?
3) What are the test and validation set, and why would you want to use them?
4) What are the main preprocessing steps? Explain them in detail. Why we need to prepare our data?
5) How you can explore countionus and discrete variables?
6) Analyse the plot given below. (What is the plot and variable type, check the distribution and make comment about how you can preproccess it.)
