Homework 1

1) How would you define Machine Learning?    
 Answer:
     Machine Learning is an Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) it gives devices the ability to 
     learn from their experiences and improve their self without doing any coding. For Example, 
     when you shop from any website itâ€™s shows related search like:- People who bought also saw this.

        Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is 
     the study of making machines more human-like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to 
     learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, 

      i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on 
     the experiences of the machines throughout the process. Good quality data is fed to the machines, 
     and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. 
     The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand, 
     and the type of activity that needs to be automated.

2) What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning? Specify example 3 algorithms for each of these.
 Answer:
   
1) How would you define Machine Learning?
3) What are the test and validation set, and why would you want to use them?
4) What are the main preprocessing steps? Explain them in detail. Why we need to prepare our data?
5) How you can explore countionus and discrete variables?
6) Analyse the plot given below. (What is the plot and variable type, check the distribution and make comment about how you can preproccess it.)
